# javascript-cucumber

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cyber-dojo-languages/javascript-cucumber.svg?branch=master)

Currently broken :-(

I need to do a global install of Cucumber, because
I want to install it when I build the image so I can
share it among all users of the container (there may be several).
Any ideas?
